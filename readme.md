# Arduino Powered Floppy Disk Reader and Writer
...with 3rd party interfaces for Amiga, ATARI ST and DOS/PC Disk formats

# This repo adds a GTK+ GUI for linux
To compile: make all; ./GarduinoReaderWriter

# What is it?
This project uses an Arduino to interface with a floppy disk drive and 
communicate with a PC in order to recover the data from any formatted 
disks. This includes Windows software to copy from and to ADF files.

# WinUAE
This release added support for WinUAE, and hopefully could be ported to other
UAE's in the future.

# Formats
The Arduino firmware allows to read the raw MFM data from each track of the
floppy. Decoding of the sector data is done on the PC. Usually a floppy image
file is created (ADF for AMIGA, .img for ATARI ST and PC/DOS).

The 'firmware' can read MFM data from SD, DD and HD disks, although HD is untested.
This would therefore be able to read data from AMIGA, ATARI ST, PC DOS, COMMODORE C64 etc.

# ArduinoFloppyReader
This **Visual Studio 2019** and **Linux** project contains two applications, a command line, 
and a Windows dialog based application allow reading and writing of Amiga 
formatted DD floppy disks.
Using the supplied makefile you should be able to **compile this on Linux**.  It has
been tested with Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian - Debian-based)

# Scripts for linux
The above application apparently works under WINE, however,
Github user "kollokollo" made some scripts for reading other formats on Linux 
too as follows:
	The ATARI ST and DOS/PC floppy formats can be decoded whit these scripts.
	9,10,11 or 18 Sectors per track. Up to 82 tracks, DD (ca. 800 kBytes) or 
	HD (1.4 MBytes). The images usually contain a FAT12 file system which can be 
	directly mounted by linux without any additional driver.   
	For more information see 
		https://github.com/kollokollo/ArduinoFloppyDiskReader/tree/new/for_linux
		They need the X11-Basic interpreter from http://x11-basic.sourceforge.net/

# Commodore 1581 Disks

# FloppyDriverController.sketch
This is the Arduino source code/sketch for all Floppy formats.
* Detect disk density (SD/DD or HD)
* Motor ON/OFF
* Seek to Track 0
* Seek to any track (up to 82 - be careful, this can damage some drives!)
* read write protection status
* Read index pulse
* read raw track data (its, RAW, so FM, MFM; SD, DD or HD)
* write track data (un-buffered, DD, untested HD) with precompensation

# AVR Firmware
If you want to use the AVR directly instead of within the Arduino environment, 
then jump to [https://github.com/jtsiomb/usbamigafloppy] where John Tsiombikas 
has ported the code.

# Whats changed?
* v2.5 (firmware 1.8a) - Add support for 'noclick'
* v2.5  A whole load of changes including:
        Fixed an encoding issue which prevented disks being read under Kickstart 1.3 or lower.
		Added support for read "streaming" with index sync support        
        Changed read timings slightly which means more disks can now be recovered!
		Added support for PRECOMP disk writing to improve readability as you go past track 40
        Added some new functions which allow for more direct control of the drive        
* v2.4  Improved support for Usb to Serial devices based on findings from GitHub user "prickle" - firmware is now V1.7
* v2.33 Merged with Pull Request #9 (Detect and read out HD floppy disks 1.44M by kollokollo) - firmware is now V1.6
* v2.32 Merged with Pull Request #6 (Modified the behavior of the current track location on Arduino boot - paulofduarte) which also addresses issues with some drives and updated firmware to 1.4
      Made a small change to the diagnostics code to also erase the track before writing it
* v2.31 Upgraded the PC code side to work with Visual Studio 2019 resolving issue #11 (ourIThome) and merging pull request #13 (bassclefstudio)
      Fixed a few typos in ArduinoInterface.cpp from pull request #12 (Crkk)
* V2.2  Fixed 99% of checksum errors when writing by erasing the track first
* V2.1  Diagnostics and potential write bug fixed
* V2.0  Disk reading has been vastly improved and you can now also write disks!
* V1.0  Initial release, can read disks fairly well
